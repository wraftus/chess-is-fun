chess_is_fun

* "Simple" chess engine for fun
* Start with one implementation, maybe try different ones down the road see which one is better

Implementation - attempt 1

* Need some value function for board states
** V = 1 -> win
** V = 0 -> tie
** V = -1 -> lose
** Train NN to compute value function

* To train NN we need to serialize the board state
** Pieces
*** Empty - 0x0
*** Pawn - 0x1, 0x9
*** Rook - 0x2, 0xA
*** Knight - 0x4, 0xC
*** Bishop - 0x5, 0xD
*** Queen - 0x6, 0xE
*** King - 0x7, 0xF

** Other States
*** Who's turn - extra 257th bit
*** Pawn's first move available - can be infered from position of pawn
*** Castle available - 0x3 and 0xB indaicate rooks that can be castled with 
*** En Passent available - 0x8 behind a pawn indicates that pawn is vunerable

** 8x8 Board
** 2 players x 6 pieces + blank = 13 piece states (4 bits)
** Who's turn -> 5th bit
** 8x8x5 bit state 
** (maybe try running CNN on board state without who's turn, but add it to the end of the linear layer)
